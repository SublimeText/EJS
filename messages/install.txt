## Requirements

This package requires that you also install the "Babel" package.


## Color Scheme

EJS 2 comes with the "Dracula EJS" color scheme which you can select from: `Preferences` -> `Color Scheme` -> `EJS 2`.
Oceanic Next (https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) is also a good color scheme for EJS that works right out of the box.

If you'd prefer to use a different color scheme, you may need to add lines like [these](https://github.com/nwoltman/sublime-ejs/blob/master/Dracula%20EJS.YAML-tmTheme#L228-241) to make the highlighting more compatible with EJS.


## Setting the default syntax

To set the default EJS syntax for a particular file extension:

1. Open a file with that extension
2. Select `View` from the menu
3. Then `Syntax` &rarr; `Open all with current extension as...` &rarr; `EJS 2` &rarr; `EJS (<delimiter>)`
4. Repeat this for each extension (i.e. `.ejs`)

If you're not using the default delimiters (`<% %>`), you'll want to use the EJS syntax that corresponds with the delimiters you use.
This package includes syntax definitions for the following additional delimiters: `<? ?>`, `<$ $>`, `<@ @>`.
